--- FAQ ---
Q: How do I play the Gaiden exclusive game mode?
A: Use the special code "fanatix" when the randomizer asks for flags. This is a hack 'n slash mode for FF6, similar to a roguelike or ancient cave, but much more linear.

Q: What support is there for RotDS?
A: Currently only the monster flag is supported for RotDS 2.4. There is no "fanatix" flag support either. Documentation on randomized data is also created with the ROM.

--- HOW TO USE ---
About:
    Beyond Chaos Gaiden is my second FF6 randomizer, developed using my latest tools and experience. It is designed to be portable to many different versions of FF6, such as the Japanese version and Brave New World.

Running the randomizer:
    Run "randomizer.py" using Python version 3.7 or higher.

Source rom file:
    This randomizer is compatible with the following roms:
        FF3 SNES NA 1.0     e986575b98300f721ce27c180264d890
        FF6 SFC JP          97bf78e916b80f47cf35edf502be34dc
        FF6 ROTDS 2.4       737bf42957b69262d1ff536e28ec7ece
        FF6 BNW 1.9         54427dfadea94ef32acd77be78137ac5
    Other FF6 SNES mods, such as Beyond Chaos seeds, might also be compatible by selecting "FF6_NA_SAFE_MODE" when prompted.

Seed value:
    Input a seed value here, or leave it blank if you don't care.

Flags:
    a  Randomize esper allocations.
    c  Randomize characters.
    e  Randomize espers.
    g  Randomize magicite.
    m  Randomize monsters.
    p  Randomize shops.
    q  Randomize equipment.
    r  Randomize rng.
    t  Randomize treasure.
    v  Randomize nothing. (for when you want to play "fanatix" mode without any randomizations)

Randomness:
    The "randomness" option controls how extreme the randomizations are. At 0.0, almost nothing will be randomized. At 1.0, enemies in the starting area will most likely have boss stats. I suggest leaving it at the default setting of 0.5 for your first run.
    It is possible to use different settings for different flags. Type "custom" to enable more detailed randomness settings. This is useful, for example, when you want to find high-level gear without fighting high-level enemies.

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized rom with the seed in the filename.
    A folder "docs_{seed_number}" will be created with some documentation on the randomized data. (only supported with RotDS ROMs for now)
